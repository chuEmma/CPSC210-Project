This was a project created using Java in my CPSC 210 class at UBC in the summer of 2019.

Throughout this project, we were required to follow a weekly criteria for our code 
(for instance, creating multiple classes, using JAVA design patterns, etc.). However, we were allowed to choose what we
would like to do.

This project is a simple menu interface for restaurants. The following are some of its functions:

1. Clock in and clock out employees
2. Password protected (employees must enter in their own specific access code to order)
3. Order food for specific tables and calculate total price
4. Print receipt with total prices and tax
